## Call for United Actions to Protect Academic Freedom

We are currently issuing a united lawsuit against PP 10043. Litigation feasibility: The H1B-related proclamation was previously blocked by lawsuits started by students, so we can also resolve the case of 10043 by law. At present, we have consulted with the experienced ones who have successfully implemented OPT litigation. We will start planning as soon as possible and look for lawyers. 

At present, we hope everyone expand their influence so that students who are willing to participate in the litigation will know and join us. We hope you will actively forward this call. We also hope that everyone can help consult the legal department of their school, collect the lawyer resources recommended by the school, and work together to push down this unfair prohibition. If you are willing to contribute, welcome to join us!

We already have a core team of 30 who are collaborating with students who have succeeded in the H1B and OPT litigation to advance litigation-related matters.

Already 1k+ people have joined our WeChat group and expressed their willingness to support.
