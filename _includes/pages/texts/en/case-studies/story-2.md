I am an undergraduate student of Beihang University who graduated in the year of 2018.

In fact, I have always had a good impression of the United States, right from junior high school. Very early on, I've firmly established my idea of ​​studying in the United States. To me, American higher education is very prestigious in the world. I prepared for summer research internship since my junior year, and then successfully had two good experiences in the Minnesota Twins and the University of Washington. After graduation, I went to USC to study for a master's degree in quantum computing. It was a natural choice for further pursue my Ph.D.  in USC afterwards.

The 1 year and half master program is fulfilling and interesting, but I never went home, so I decided to go back to Hubei to visit my family in January 2020. I plan to stay in China for half a year, find an internship, and then return to school in the fall. However, everything is messed up by the pandemic...

First of all, it is the new covid-19 epidemic. The home lockdown in Hubei is very strict. During the two months at home, I had been were a little depressed and gained a crazy weight of 20 pounds. Later, as the virus spread to the world, it was discovered that the United States was gradually negative in dealing with the epidemic. Immediately around April or May, Trump also set the tone for his re-election strategy, which was anti-China, and Presidential Proclamation 10043 appeared in this general environment. In September, the five-year master's visa applied for in 2018 was revoked, and the bad news of the so-called National Defense Seventh and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications students’ visa rejections continued to appear. The mentality began to collapse a little.  Maybe Biden will re-welcome us Chinese students after winning the general election.

At the beginning of the US general election in November, the votes of the two candidates are being swiped every day. Every time I see the key swing states turn from red to blue, I am ecstatic, as if as long as Biden wins the election, I will be welcomed by the United States again and my F1 student visa application would be  as smooth as my J visa application.

However, this is not the case. The new government overturned many policies, but its China policy has hardly changed. I came to Singapore in early April to apply for an F1 visa and was rejected by Presidential Proclamation 10043. I could not get effective help even when I asked for help. I think this is probably the end of my American education. Very sad and even desperate. We were refused to go to the United States to be students not because we committed any mistakes, but because  of our undergraduate school. That is absurd and I was very helpless. Under the environment of confrontation between the United States and China, the chance of 10043 being loosened is very slim. . When the dust of the times falls on a person, it is a big mountain...

<!-- 原文：我是北航14级本科生，18年毕业。
其实一直对美国都挺有好感的吧，从初中开始。很早就坚定了赴美深造的想法。毕竟美国的高等教育也是世界上独树一帜的存在。从大三开始就准备暑研，然后成功地在明尼苏达双城和华盛顿大学有两段不错的经历。毕业后去南加大读硕士，方向是量子计算，后来博士留在南加大也是自然的选择。
硕士一年半的时间过得充实而有趣，然而一直没回家，所以决定在2020年1月回湖北看看家人。打算在国内待半年，找个实习，然后秋季返校，然而一切都被飞来横祸打乱了计划…
首先是新冠疫情吧，湖北的居家封锁非常严格，在家的那两月人被关的有点抑郁，疯狂长胖20斤。后来随着病毒扩散至全球，发现美国在处理疫情的问题上逐渐消极。随即大约在4，5月份时川普也给连任的选举策略定调，就是反中，总统令10043在这个大环境下出现。9月的时候2018年申请的硕士5年签证被撤销，所谓国防七子以及北邮同学签证被拒的噩耗也不断出现，心态开始有点崩溃，每天早上醒来就想哭，但是想着咬咬牙等着，说不定拜登赢得大选会重新欢迎我们中国留学生。
11月美国大选开始，每天都在刷两位候选人的票数，每次看到关键的摇摆州从红翻蓝都欣喜若狂，仿佛只要拜登赢下选举我就能重新被美国欢迎，就像当年申请J签F签那样一切顺利的回去。
事实并非如此，新政府推翻了很多政策，然而对华政策几乎没有任何改变。我4月初来到新加坡申请F1签证也被总统令10043拒绝，求助于学校也无法获得有效的帮助，我想大概这就是我接受美国教育的终点了吧。非常悲伤难过，我们被拒绝去美国当学生并不是因为我们犯下了什么过错，而是因为我们的本科学校，很荒谬也很无奈，在美中对抗的大环境下感觉10043松绑的机会十分渺茫。时代的灰尘落在一个人身上就是一座大山… -->
