I received and confirmed with an offer of PhD in Physics from an American University in February 2020, but due to the epidemic and Presidential Proclamation10043 (pp10043), I was unable to obtain a valid visa, therefore, I had no choice but to attend the online class with a the 12-hour time-zone difference.

This year, I was unable to lead a normal life: I went out at night and did not have any social interactions; under academic pressure, I was distracted from time to time by anxiety about whether I could obtain a valid visa. I was tortured by sadness, anger, and anxiety in many unmanned nights.

I'm just an innocent student, but I was treated unfairly from pp10043, just because I studied at one of the seven universities? I always pay attention to people like me who have been rejected for visas because of pp10043. pp10043 is an unfair policy. It blocks academic freedom and academic exchanges. It also hurts the studies of countless innocent students like me who continue to study for academic dreams.

Please revoke pp10043 and rebuild the path of academic exchange!

<!--  中文原文： 我于2020年二月收到了美国大学的物理学博士offer，但是因为疫情加上pp10043无法获得有效签证，不得不选择了在十二小时时差的中国日夜颠倒上网课。
这一年，我无法正常的生活：昼伏夜出，没有任何社交；在学业压力之下，还要时不时受到是否能够获得有效签证的焦虑情绪干扰。很多个无人的夜里，我都饱受悲伤，愤怒，焦虑情绪折磨。
我只是一个清白的学生，却受到了来自pp10043的不公平对待，仅仅是因为我在七子之一的大学读过书？我时刻关注着和我一样的人，他们因为pp10043毫无根据地被reject签证。pp10043是一个不公平的政策，它阻断了学术自由，阻断了学术交流，更伤害了无数像我一样为了学术梦想而不断学习的无辜学生的学业。
恳请撤销pp10043，重建学术交流之路！ -->
