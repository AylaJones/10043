My bachelor and master degrees are all obtained in one of "Seven Sons" universities in a biology-related major. Combining my field with computer science will efficiently lessen the diagnosis burden of doctors and achieve the mission of precision medicine, which will bring countless interests to the whole human beings. I know this and regard it as my ultimate goal, thus I transformed my major into computer science and got a PhD offer in a university in the US with a fully-funded scholarship through my persistence, diligence and intelligence. Being the US also means gathering with my dear girl friend who has already being doing her master degree in the US and we will be in the same city if things go well. However, the decline letter with pp 10043 reason from visa interview window torn my dream and expectation.

In the beginning of 2021, I chose to travel to Singapore to do US visa interview because I believe I am irrelevant to Military Civil Fusion Strategies after I read its definition. My previous research projects are irrelevant to MCF and I have two episodes of travel experience to the US before. I sincerely believe visa officer will comprehensively review applicantsâ€™ background and make a wise and neutral decision. Thus, I confidently stood in the front of the visa officer.

On the interview day, everything went well at the start. He said he understood transforming major to computer science is typical. Knowing my program is fully funded by a US university, he nodded and warned me not to forget to do test COVID-19 before flying to the US. However, he found information in my education background and asked my previous education institution. I frankly answered. He refused to take my materials and provide a decline letter with reason pp10043. My dream fell apart and my mind is empty with such a ridiculous reason.

I have already had online-courses for one year and achieved A in all of them, though breaking the circadian rhythms makes me exhausting. It is hard to give up this program with a generous scholarship, which is also the way of paving my career and the opportunity of gathering with my dearest girl friend. It is hard to imagine pp 10043 will exist to ruin the my life and the lives of people same to me.
