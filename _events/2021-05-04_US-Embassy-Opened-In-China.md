国内已重新开签，但[最新面签结果](https://docs.qq.com/sheet/DWXhmY1J3T1lCUnpI)显示，PP10043 仍然严格执行。放弃幻想，只能诉讼。目前计划是收集尽可能多的案例作为诉讼材料，以及筹款发起诉讼。为此，请大家积极填写并转发调查问卷，问卷地址：[https://wj.qq.com/s2/8404966/e1ab/](https://wj.qq.com/s2/8404966/e1ab/ )

On May 4, 2021, The US Embassy in China has reopened to process visa applications. However, [interviewees have reported](https://docs.qq.com/sheet/DWXhmY1J3T1lCUnpI) that they are still being refused under PP10043. It is time to cast away illusions and go for a lawsuit.
The current plan is to collect as many cases as possible as litigation materials and raise funds to initiate litigation.
To this end, we ask everyone to fill in and forward our questionnaire: [https://wj.qq.com/s2/8404966/e1ab/](https://wj.qq.com/s2/8404966/e1ab/ )
