## How to add a story

All stories are stored in [https://github.com/Xivid/10043/tree/main/_stories](https://github.com/Xivid/10043/tree/main/_stories).

To add a story, please create a markdown file in both the English (/en) and the Chinese (/zh) folders. For example, go to [here](https://github.com/Xivid/10043/new/main/_stories/zh) to create the Chinese version markdown file, name it something like "4.md", and put in the content:

```
---
title: "这里写标题，不要忘记两边的英文双引号"
subtitle: "这里写副标题，不要忘记两边的英文双引号"
---

这里写具体内容
```
Then go to [here](https://github.com/Xivid/10043/new/main/_stories/en) to create the English version markdown file, use the same name as the Chinese one (`4.md` in this case), and put in the content:
```
---
title: "Write the title here, don't miss the quotation mark"
subtitle: "Write the subtitle here, don't miss the quotation mark"
---

(Write the content here)
```

When writing the markdown, make sure to follow the same format as shown above. Otherwise the website build might fail!
