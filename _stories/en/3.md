title: Please revoke pp10043 and rebuild the path of academic exchange!
subtitle: BS/MS from Seven Sons, Physics PhD in US, Taken Online Classes for One Year
---

I received and confirmed with an offer of PhD in Physics from an American University in February 2020, but due to the epidemic and Presidential Proclamation10043 (pp10043), I was unable to obtain a valid visa, therefore, I had no choice but to attend the online class with a the 12-hour time-zone difference.

This year, I was unable to lead a normal life: I went out at night and did not have any social interactions; under academic pressure, I was distracted from time to time by anxiety about whether I could obtain a valid visa. I was tortured by sadness, anger, and anxiety in many unmanned nights.

I'm just an innocent student, but I was treated unfairly from pp10043, just because I studied at one of the seven universities? I always pay attention to people like me who have been rejected for visas because of pp10043. pp10043 is an unfair policy. It blocks academic freedom and academic exchanges. It also hurts the studies of countless innocent students like me who continue to study for academic dreams.

Please revoke pp10043 and rebuild the path of academic exchange!
