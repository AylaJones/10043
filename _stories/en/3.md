title: Stop the Presidential Proclamation 10043 and restore the pathway of academic exchange!
subtitle: A Year of Online Courses—the breakdown of a physics Ph.D. student.
---




<!--- 我于2020年二月收到了美国大学的物理学博士offer，但是因为疫情加上pp10043无法获得有效签证，不得不选择了在十二小时时差的中国日夜颠倒上网课。--->

In Feb. 2020, I received a Ph.D. offer in Physics from a US institution. However, the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the President Proclamation 10043 (PP. 10043) blocked Chinese student visas and forced me to study remotely in China, where there is 12 hours’ difference from the US. From then on, I spent my entire year in sleep-wake inversion.
<!--- 这一年，我无法正常的生活：昼伏夜出，没有任何社交；在学业压力之下，还要时不时受到是否能够获得有效签证的焦虑情绪干扰。很多个无人的夜里，我都饱受悲伤，愤怒，焦虑情绪折磨。--->



Not a single day in this year have I spent in a normal way. Days and nights completely inversed. Social interaction entirely deprived. Endless worries of getting a valid visa haunted me even when I was heavily burdened by academic tasks. I was also mentally afflicted in many desperate nights by constant anger, sadness, and anxiety.

<!--- 我只是一个清白的学生，却受到了来自pp10043的不公平对待，仅仅是因为我在七子之一的大学读过书？我时刻关注着和我一样的人，他们因为pp10043毫无根据地被reject签证。pp10043是一个不公平的政策，它阻断了学术自由，阻断了学术交流，更伤害了无数像我一样为了学术梦想而不断学习的无辜学生的学业。恳请撤销pp10043，重建学术交流之路！

As a mere innocent student, I don’t think I deserve to be ill-treated by the PP.10043 just because I have studied in one of the universities on the list. I kept paying attention to people like me who have also been rejected for visas on no grounds by unfair PP.10043. It blocks academic freedom, erodes educational exchanges, and hurtfully prevents countless innocent and hardworking students from pursuing their academic goals. In this case, I sincerely hope that PP 10043 could be revoked, and the pathway of academic exchange be restored.
