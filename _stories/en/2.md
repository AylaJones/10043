subtitle: USC MS/PhD, Held Back in China by COVID, Visa Refused for Returning to the US
---
I am an undergraduate student of Beihang University who graduated in the year of 2018.

In fact, I have always had a good impression of the United States, right from junior high school. Very early on, I’ve firmly established my idea of ​​studying in the United States. To me, American higher education is very prestigious in the world. I prepared for summer research internship since my junior year, and then successfully had two good experiences in the Minnesota Twins and the University of Washington. After graduation, I went to USC to study for a master’s degree in quantum computing. It was a natural choice for further pursue my Ph.D. in USC afterwards.

The 1 year and half master program is fulfilling and interesting, but I never went home, so I decided to go back to Hubei to visit my family in January 2020. I plan to stay in China for half a year, find an internship, and then return to school in the fall. However, everything is messed up by the pandemic…

First of all, it is the new covid-19 epidemic. The home lockdown in Hubei is very strict. During the two months at home, I had been were a little depressed and gained a crazy weight of 20 pounds. Later, as the virus spread to the world, it was discovered that the United States was gradually negative in dealing with the epidemic. Immediately around April or May, Trump also set the tone for his re-election strategy, which was anti-China, and Presidential Proclamation 10043 appeared in this general environment. In September, the five-year master’s visa applied for in 2018 was revoked, and the bad news of the so-called National Defense Seventh and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications students’ visa rejections continued to appear. The mentality began to collapse a little. Maybe Biden will re-welcome us Chinese students after winning the general election.

At the beginning of the US general election in November, the votes of the two candidates are being swiped every day. Every time I see the key swing states turn from red to blue, I am ecstatic, as if as long as Biden wins the election, I will be welcomed by the United States again and my F1 student visa application would be as smooth as my J visa application.

However, this is not the case. The new government overturned many policies, but its China policy has hardly changed. I came to Singapore in early April to apply for an F1 visa and was rejected by Presidential Proclamation 10043. I could not get effective help even when I asked for help. I think this is probably the end of my American education. Very sad and even desperate. We were refused to go to the United States to be students not because we committed any mistakes, but because of our undergraduate school. That is absurd and I was very helpless. Under the environment of confrontation between the United States and China, the chance of 10043 being loosened is very slim. When the dust of the times falls on a person, it is a big mountain…
